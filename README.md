# hello-world
My GitHub tutorial. The README file is for the project description and any other info we might want to include.
In this tutorial I have learned how to:
1. Open a repository
2. Create a README
3. Create an issue
4. How to create a branch from the Master Branch 
(I have added some changes to the read me that should only be on the readMe-edit branch)
